# **Justification Memo**  

**To:** Dr. Alan Thomas Kohler  
**From:** Jonathan He  
**Date:** April 25, 2025  
**Subject:** Application of Communication Skills Learned in Class to Other Coursework  

---

## **Skills Learned**
- **Assertion-Evidence Slide Design**
- **IMRD (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) Format**
- **Effective Use of Hand Gestures**
- **Known/New Information Structuring**

---

## **Application of Skills**

### **1. Assertion-Evidence Slide Design**
In course **24-665 (Wearable Health)**, I applied the assertion-evidence approach to all presentation slides. Instead of using vague titles, each slide began with a clear, declarative statement summarizing the key takeaway. This significantly improved audience comprehension and engagement. As a result, I earned a perfect score (**10/10**) on the presentation.

---

### **2. Effective Use of Hand Gestures**
During the Wearable Health presentation, I deliberately used hand gestures to support my verbal communication:
- **Topic Introduction Gesture:** Used a broad open-hand motion to introduce new topics.
- **Bullet Emphasis Gesture:** Used finger-pointing motions to guide the audience through key bullet points.
- **Summary Sweep Gesture:** Used a sweeping motion to summarize major takeaways.

These gestures helped provide visual structure for the audience and emphasized key transitions during the talk.

---

### **3. IMRD Format in Report Writing**
In course **24-782 (AI Engineering Project)**, our final report strictly followed the IMRD structure:
- **Introduction:** Introduced the background of imitation learning and its relevance to humanoid locomotion.
- **Methods:** Described our approach to applying imitation learning algorithms to train a walking agent.
- **Results:** Presented experimental outcomes, performance metrics, and visual results.
- **Discussion:** Analyzed the strengths, limitations, and proposed future work.

This structure improved readability and made our logical progression clear to readers.

---

### **4. Known/New Information Structuring**
Throughout the AI Engineering report, I applied the **known/new** strategy to improve coherence. For example, after explaining what imitation learning is (known), the next section naturally transitioned into how our team applied it (new). This technique made the report smoother and easier to follow.
